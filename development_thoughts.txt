Having only done a little bit of Elixir, I thought it would be a nice option for my second version
 of the powerset calculator.

 I created modules for the calculator and the file reader functionality, and could possibly extract
 the actual powersets into structures that will let me work in a little more typed system.

 I started out with creation of the calculator module.  much of the functionality is basically the same, 
 but instead of bit shifting, I used recursion, passing around the [head|tail] of the input and 
 then sorting the output powersets so that they would order correctly.

 The hardest part so far was actually formatting the list into the output string.  It worked for
 single dimensional lists, but when I hit a multi-dimensional (ie:{a,b}), I had to recursively 
 format that list as well.

 I overloaded the parsing so that we can show when the path to the file is incorrect
